# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a modern data warehouse and analytics solution. It spans the entire data pipeline, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, from building a data warehouse to cleansing and transforming raw data from multiple source systems, and finally performing SQL-based analytics to generate actionable insights. The project includes data engineering processes like data integration, cleansing, and transformation, as well as the use of analytics to derive meaningful business insights from the data.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Data Warehouse Development (Data Engineering)
- **Consolidate and store sales data** from multiple sources (ERP and CRM) into a unified data warehouse.
- **Cleanse and resolve data quality issues** to ensure data integrity for analysis.
- **Create a robust and well-documented data model** that supports complex analytical queries.

### 2. SQL Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
- Develop SQL queries and views to extract insights into key business areas, such as:
  - **Customer Behavior**: Identifying purchasing trends and segmenting customers.
  - **Product Performance**: Analyzing product sales and demand.
  - **Sales Trends**: Measuring sales performance over time.
- Provide key business insights to support data-driven decision-making.
- Document the data model and the SQL queries to ensure clarity and understanding for both business stakeholders and the analytics team.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform **EDA** to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses that inform further analysis.
- Visualize key data relationships, trends, and distributions that will guide the design of the data warehouse and the creation of SQL analytics queries.

### 4. Power BI Dashboards (In Development)
- A planned future development will involve creating interactive dashboards in Power BI that provide visual insights into the business metrics.
- Dashboards will allow users to explore sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior in real-time.
